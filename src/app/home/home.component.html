  <p>We love tacos. All kinds of tacos. And we love being creative with the way we make our tacos.</p><br>
  <p>Some taco joints offer a set, finite menu of tacos to choose from. At Taco Cloud, we want to share
    the joy of taco creativity with you, allowing you to design your own tacos from a palette of fresh
    and delicious ingredients. While we may offer some of our creations for you to try, the real fun
    is when you create your own tortilla-wrapped works of art.</p><br>
  <p>And, even though we love tacos and creativity, we prefer to avoid doing complex math. That's why
    all tacos are priced modestly at $4.99 each, no matter how many or what ingredients you choose.</p><br>  
  <p>Click <a href="design"><button mat-raised-button color="accent">here</button></a> to get started on your taco masterpiece!</p>
